# Evaluation-of-QOE-through-Trace-Driven-Emulation

Providing best user experience for video on demand services is possible by quantifying users’ experience using QOE metrics. Depending on the type of measurement, QOE metrics can be classified as subjective and objective metrics. Measurement of subjective QOE metrics is influenced by psychological factors of the user, and hence is biased and varies from one user to another, making it tedious and hard to measure.

Earlier research works measured objective metrics like playback start time, number of interruptions, average bitrate, etc. But neither did they conduct experiment in real time network conditions nor did they consider different bandwidths patterns(consisting of both long and short bandwidth variations). This work proposes a real time trace driven emulation testbed to evaluate objective QOE metrics. The aim of this work is two fold: to create an emulation testbed capable of replicating wide–range network conditions using real time bandwidth traces and to do an extensive analysis of different rate adaptation algorithms for dash by choosing noteworthy QOE metrics under different real-time trace driven network conditions.
